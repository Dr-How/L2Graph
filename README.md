Boyd--Maxwell ball packing is a class of infinite ball packings that are generated by inversions.  Maxwell (1982) proved that the balls in such a packing correspond to the space-like weights of a Lorentzian Coxeter system of level 2.  For definition of level and more detailed mathematics, please refer to [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8608).

This is the sage code that implements the algorithm described in the paper.  After loading the code in Sage, it will generates the images of 326 level-2 Coxeter graphs, grouped into different eps files by type and number of vertices.
