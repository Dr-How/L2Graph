This folder contains the list of 326 Coxeter groups of level 2.  There are .eps files for Coxeter diagrams, and .txt files with GraphViz strings of the Coxeter diagrams.  The last number in the filename is the number vertices of the Coxeter graph.  The other part of the filename is an internal code for the type of the graph.  Files with name "max" include all graphs with a given number of vertices.

Each vertex corresponds to a mirror, which is a plane or sphere in the 3D space.  In the .eps files, white and gray vertices represent "real vertices"; they have corresponding actual spheres.  The sphere packing is the orbits of the actual spheres under the group generated by reflections in the mirrors.
